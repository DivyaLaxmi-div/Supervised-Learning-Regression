# Simple Linear Regression

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Simple Linear Regression** model using Python.

### 🔍 Objective:
Predict a dependent variable (output) using one independent variable (input). This is the simplest form of regression, commonly used in real-world scenarios like predicting sales, prices, or trends.

### 📂 Files:
- `Simple_Linear_Regression.ipynb` – Contains code, explanation, and visualization of the model.

### ✅ Key Concepts:
- Linear relationship between two variables
- Train-Test Split
- Model fitting and prediction using `sklearn`
- Visualization using `matplotlib`
